# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
- It felt challenging, but when working through it I just had to focus on it one step at a time, and I got it. My biggest issue was two synax errors towards the end after helping others for hours, and it was something that I knew but since I was so tired, it took me around 5 mins just to find out where my missing end was. 
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
- Going great, I feel that I understand all of this so far and I was even able to help others for the rest of my time. Allthough I need to take more breaks, today I was helping people from 4:00-7:30 and it was draining. I definetely need to take more breaks in between all of the work.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
- I think I need to plan out my day a little bit better, and thats it. I think that if I can plan out my day a little more organized, it will definenitly make it alot easier.
